# 30 day challange in C++

If you want to really learn a programming language, a good way is to do the 30 day challange on https://www.hackerrank.com.

Here are my solutions for the last 20 or so days. The first week is so is quite trivial.

we're going further with Binary Search Trees. A level-order traversal, 
also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You 
are given a pointer, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the *levelOrder* 
function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.
