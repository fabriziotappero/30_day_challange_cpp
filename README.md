# 30 day challange in C++

If you want to really learn a programming language, a good way is to do the 30 day 
challange on https://www.hackerrank.com.

Here are my solutions for the last 15 or so days. The first weeks are actually quite trivial.

## DAY 21: C++ Generics
Today we're discussing Generics. Write a single generic function named *printArray*. This 
function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this 
is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

    21-generics.cpp
    
## DAY 22: Binary Search Trees - Height
The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root 
and its furthest leaf. You are given a pointer, root, pointing to the root of a binary 
search tree. Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns 
the height of the binary search tree.

    22-binarySearchTree-height.cpp

## DAY 23: Binary Search Trees - Travers
we're going further with Binary Search Trees. A level-order traversal, 
also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to 
right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, pointing to the root of a binary search 
tree. Complete the *levelOrder* function provided in your editor so that it prints the 
level-order traversal of the binary search tree.
